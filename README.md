# Stardew Valley Anthro Farmer Mod
- Based on LackeDragon's classic *Furry/Anthro Player* mod ( https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/classic-furry-anthro-player.112597/ )
- Repackaged as a Content Patcher mod.
- Sprite sheets updated for Stardew Valley 1.5 (partially, Fox is completed)

## Install
1. Install the latest version of SMAPI: https://smapi.io
2. Install Content Patcher: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915
3. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`
4. Run the game using SMAPI.
5. *(Optional)* Edit the `config.json` file in the mod folder to change `FarmerSpecies` to either `Fox`, `Wolf`, or `Cat` and restart.

## Credits
- Sprite assets by LackeDragon, edited to incorporate the rest of the torso sprites from vanilla Stardew Valley.

## Support
- Likely none, I made this just to make it work.
